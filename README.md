ðŸš€ Exploring Heart Disease Data with Python! ðŸ©ºðŸ“Š

I recently completed a data analysis project using Python to visualize heart disease data. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the charts I created:

Bar Chart: Visualized the distribution of heart disease values.

Pie Chart: Showed the proportion of individuals with and without heart disease.

Pie Chart: Analyzed the male-to-female ratio in the dataset.

Count Plot: Compared heart disease frequency across different sexes.

Bar Chart: Examined different types of chest pain and their counts.

Pie Chart: Analyzed fasting blood sugar levels.

Scatter Plot: Explored the relationship between age and maximum heart rate for individuals with and without heart disease.

Count Plot: Investigated exercise-induced angina across genders.

Bar Chart: Cross-tabulated fasting blood sugar levels with gender.

I used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to create these visualizations. This project has been a fantastic way to practice data visualization and analysis. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss data analysis or share insights!
